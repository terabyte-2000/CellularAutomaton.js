# CellularAutomaton.js
### A library for creating (2D) cellular automata 
##### and really anything that has to do with changing stuff on a grid
---

## How to use:
Take a look at gameOfLife.js, blur.js, or sandpiles.js in the examples directory. I'll add some JSDoc stuff for the library.

## Link to the library:
https://cellular-automaton.harinarayancn.repl.co/src/CellularAutomaton.js

Just put this line in your HTML:
```html
<script src="https://cellular-automaton.harinarayancn.repl.co/src/CellularAutomaton.js"></script>
```
in the ```<head>``` or after ```</body>``` or really wherever. Just put your own script after you include the library.

I haven't really finished with the library but once I'm done I'll push out a minified version.

I might push out a basic tutorial later but I doubt it will happen soon.
